# AI4S Cup Getting Started Competition - Central Nervous System (CNS) drug development: drug screening and optimization
### Competition Introduction Background
Central nervous system (CNS) diseases have long had significant unmet clinical needs. According to statistics, with the current trend of population aging, the treatment costs for neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's (AD) and Parkinson's (PD), as well as brain cancer, stroke, and other diseases, will reach trillions of dollars, resulting in enormous healthcare expenditures. Therefore, obtaining high-quality and effective CNS drugs is currently regarded as having important scientific and commercial value.

With the rise of AI for science, AI can screen for drugs with potential therapeutic effects in large-scale compound libraries, and predict the pharmacological activity, toxicity, and pharmacokinetic properties of drugs based on computer simulation methods. In this way, AI can screen out the most promising drug candidates and optimize their chemical structures to improve safety and efficacy.

In this competition, a set of molecular information data will be provided, and participants need to use AI methods to detect whether the molecules can be used as CNS drugs, achieving CNS drug screening and research and development work with the help of AI.
